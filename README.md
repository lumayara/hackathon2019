WELCOME TO THE DOCUMENTATION OF MICARTERITA

As part of the cash reduction program and leveraging emerging technologies, Costa Rica government has pushed for tech solutions that can build an ecosystem upon the social benefits the government is paying to civil society.
MiCarterita is designed to become the first interoperable digital platform where beneficiaries will not only receive their social benefits from different programs also will serve as payment platform. 
Understanding the lack of stickiness as one of the major challenges for digital wallets success, MiCarterita incorporates gamification as a key pillar to be part of the daily life of the users.
The ecosystem where beneficiaries could spend their money and points includes, public transport, consumer goods stores, other financial services providers, among others.
USER GUIDE

The user logs in with the credentials they have from SINIRUBE.  The user name is the phone number and password are registered with the SINIRUBE system. To change the credentials, the user needs to contact SINIRUBE.

After logging in, the user has access to the menu with the available options. The beneficiaries will be able to see the total of benefits received that month, their Profile, Notifications, Transfer and Pay money, see their points and rewards, access to other products if they have digital signature and see their transaction history. Users can also benefit from the accessibility options by enabling audio, they can hear each menu option by tapping once in each item or they can make transfer by voice command.

To see the notifications the user will see in their screen when they receive the push and they can also see the notification messages through the app by clicking on the bell that appears at the top right.
They can also see their profile which will show their points, the option to redeem and the social benefits that the user is enrolled.

The next option is to transfer or pay. To transfer to someone, the user can search their information by number and inform the amount. If they just want to pay, they can show the QR Code and the store/business will scan it, the user will get a message to confirm the transaction for security and once the user confirms, the money is deduct the amount from their account.



The next option is to see where they can use their points or what was redeemed as well as see what other opportunities to get more points are.

The section of other products is where we envision the use of the app integrated with digital signature to access/purchases services through it as for an example the Seguro Estudantil.
	


Last option is to see the transaction history. The user will see the history of payments, transfer and benefits received.
